# Sniffy
Very lousy traffic sniffer, offbrand tcpdump, essentially a gui for scapy's sniff function
*Has buffering issue either inherently because the way I programmed it or could maybe use threading/microprocessing, either way the application hangs during the duration of it sniffing traffic*

**will need NPCAP to put nic in monitor mode on windows, also need pyqt**
